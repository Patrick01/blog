The unbelievable good math channel 3Blue1Brown has a video about the [Fourier Transformation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY). I want to try some things from there in R. I will further copy/steal from the [notes](http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/r/fourier/fourier.html) about the Fourier Transform from Joao Neto. 

The video says that one feature is the decomposition of waves to their underlying components. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)

waves <- data_frame(xs = seq(-2 * pi, 2 * pi, pi/100), 
                    wave1 = sin(3 * xs), 
                    wave2 = sin(10 * xs), 
                    comb = wave1 + wave2)

plot1 <- ggplot(waves, aes(xs, wave1)) + geom_line()
plot2 <- ggplot(waves, aes(xs, wave2)) + geom_line()
plot3 <- ggplot(waves, aes(xs, comb)) + geom_line()

(plot1 + plot2) / plot3
```
